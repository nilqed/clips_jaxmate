<h1>Section 8: Generic Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#section-8-generic-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>With the <strong>defgeneric</strong> and <strong>defmethod</strong> constructs, new generic
functions may be written directly in CLIPS. Generic functions are
similar to deffunctions because they can be used to define new
procedural code directly in CLIPS, and they can be called like any other
function (see sections 2.3.2 and 7). However, generic functions are much
more powerful because they can do different things depending on the
types (or classes) and number of their arguments. For example, a ?+?
operator could be defined which performs concatenation for strings but
still performs arithmetic addition for numbers. Generic functions are
comprised of multiple components called <strong>methods</strong>, where each method
handles different cases of arguments for the generic function. A generic
function which has more than one method is said to be <strong>overloaded</strong>.</p>
<p>Generic functions can have system functions and user-defined external
functions as <em>implicit</em> methods. For example, an overloading of the ?+?
operator to handle strings consists of two methods: 1) an implicit one
which is the system function handling numerical addition, and 2) an
explicit (user-defined) one handling string concatenation. Deffunctions,
however, may not be methods of generic functions because they are
subsumed by generic functions anyway. Deffunctions are only provided so
that basic new functions can be added directly in CLIPS without the
concerns of overloading. For example, a generic function that has only
one method that restricts only the number of arguments is equivalent to
a deffunction.</p>
<p>In most cases, generic function methods are not called directly (the
function <strong>call-specific-method</strong> described in section 12.15.8 can be
used to do so, however). CLIPS recognizes that a function call is
generic and uses the generic function?s arguments to find and execute
the appropriate method. This process is termed the <strong>generic dispatch</strong>.</p>
<div class="section" id="note-on-the-use-of-the-term-method">
<h2>8.1 Note on the Use of the Term <em>Method</em><a class="headerlink" href="#note-on-the-use-of-the-term-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Most OOP systems support procedural behavior of objects either through
message-passing (e.g. Smalltalk) or by generic functions (e.g. CLOS).
CLIPS supports both of these mechanisms, although generic functions are
not strictly part of COOL. A generic function may examine the classes of
its arguments but must still use messages within the bodies of its
methods to manipulate any arguments that are instances of user-defined
classes. Section 9 gives more details on COOL. The fact that CLIPS
supports both mechanisms leads to confusion in terminology. In OOP
systems that support message-passing only, the term <strong>method</strong> is used
to denote the different implementations of a <strong>message</strong> for different
classes. In systems that support generic functions only, however, the
term <strong>method</strong> is used to denote the different implementations of a
generic function for different sets of argument restrictions. To avoid
this confusion, the term <strong>message-handler</strong> is used to take the place
of <strong>method</strong> in the context of messages. Thus in CLIPS,
<strong>message-handlers</strong> denote the different implementations of a
<strong>message</strong> for different classes, and <strong>methods</strong> denote the different
implementations of a <strong>generic function</strong> for different sets of argument
restrictions.</p>

<div class="section" id="performance-penalty-of-generic-functions">
<h2>8.2 Performance Penalty of Generic Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#performance-penalty-of-generic-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A call to a generic function is computationally more expensive than a
call to a system function, user-defined external function or
deffunction. This is because CLIPS must first examine the function
arguments to determine which method is applicable. A performance penalty
of 15%-20% is not unexpected. Thus, generic functions should not be used
for routines for which time is critical, such as routines that are
called within a while loop, if at all possible. Also, generic functions
should always have at least two methods. Deffunctions or user-defined
external functions should be used when overloading is not required. A
system or user-defined external function that is not overloaded will, of
course, execute as quickly as ever, since the generic dispatch is
unnecessary.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="order-dependence-of-generic-function-definitions">
<h2>8.3 Order Dependence of Generic Function Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#order-dependence-of-generic-function-definitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If a construct which uses a system or user-defined external function is
loaded before a generic function that uses that function as an implicit
method, all calls to that function from that construct will bypass the
generic dispatch. For example, if a generic function which overloads the
?+? operator is defined after a rule which uses the ?+? operator, that
rule will always call the ?+? system function directly. However, similar
rules defined after the generic function will use the generic dispatch.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="defining-a-new-generic-function">
<h2>8.4 Defining a New Generic Function<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-a-new-generic-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A generic function is comprised of a header (similar to a forward
declaration) and zero or more methods. A generic function header can
either be explicitly declared by the user or implicitly declared by the
definition of at least one method. A method is comprised of six
elements: 1) a name (which identifies to which generic function the
method belongs), 2) an optional index, 3) an optional comment, 4) a set
of parameter <strong>restrictions</strong>, 5) an optional wildcard parameter
restriction to handle a variable number of arguments and 6) a sequence
of actions, or expressions, which will be executed in order when the
method is called. The parameter restrictions are used by the generic
dispatch to determine a method?s applicability to a set of arguments
when the generic function is actually called. The <strong>defgeneric</strong>
construct is used to specify the generic function header, and the
<strong>defmethod</strong> construct is used for each of the generic function?s
methods.</p>

<p>A generic function must be declared, either by a header or a method,
prior to being called from another generic function method, deffunction,
object message-handler, rule, or the top level. The only exception is a
self recursive generic function.</p>
<div class="section" id="generic-function-headers">
<h3>8.4.1 Generic Function Headers<a class="headerlink" href="#generic-function-headers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A generic function is uniquely identified by name. In order to reference
a generic function in other constructs before any of its methods are
declared, an explicit header is necessary. Otherwise, the declaration of
the first method implicitly creates a header. For example, two generic
functions whose methods mutually call the other generic function
(mutually recursive generic functions) would require explicit headers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="method-indices">
<h3>8.4.2 Method Indices<a class="headerlink" href="#method-indices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A method is uniquely identified by name and index, or by name and
parameter restrictions. Each method for a generic function is assigned a
unique integer index within the group of all methods for that generic
function. Thus, if a new method is defined which has exactly the same
name and parameter restrictions as another method, CLIPS will
automatically replace the older method. However, any difference in
parameter restrictions will cause the new method to be defined <em>in
addition to</em> the older method. To replace an old method with one that
has different parameter restrictions, the index of the old method can be
explicitly specified in the new method definition. However, the
parameter restrictions of the new method must not match that of another
method with a different index. If an index is not specified, CLIPS
assigns an index that has never been used by any method (past or
current) of this generic function. The index assigned by CLIPS can be
determined with the <strong>list-defmethods</strong> command (see section 13.10.4).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="method-parameter-restrictions">
<h3>8.4.3 Method Parameter Restrictions<a class="headerlink" href="#method-parameter-restrictions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each parameter for a method can be defined to have arbitrarily complex
restrictions or none at all. A parameter restriction is applied to a
generic function argument at run-time to determine if a particular
method will accept the argument. A parameter can have two types of
restrictions: type and query. A type restriction constrains the classes
of arguments that will be accepted for a parameter. A query restriction
is a user-defined boolean test which must be satisfied for an argument
to be acceptable. The complexity of parameter restrictions directly
affects the speed of the generic dispatch.</p>
<p>A parameter that has no restrictions means that the method will accept
any argument in that position. However, each method of a generic
function must have parameter restrictions that make it distinguishable
from all of the other methods so that the generic dispatch can tell
which one to call at run-time. If there are no applicable methods for a
particular generic function call, CLIPS will generate an error (see
section 8.5.4 for more detail).</p>
<p>A type restriction allows the user to specify a list of types (or
classes), one of which must match (or be a superclass of) the class of
the generic function argument. If COOL is not installed in the current
CLIPS configuration, the only types (or classes) available are: OBJECT,
PRIMITIVE, LEXEME, SYMBOL, STRING, NUMBER, INTEGER, FLOAT, MULTIFIELD,
FACT-ADDRESS and EXTERNAL-ADDRESS. Section 9 describes each of these
system classes. With COOL, INSTANCE, INSTANCE-ADDRESS, INSTANCE-NAME,
USER, INITIAL-OBJECT and any user-defined classes are also available.
Generic functions that use only the first group of types in their
methods will work the same whether COOL is installed or not. The classes
in a type restriction must be defined already, since they are used to
predetermine the precedence between a generic function?s methods (see
section 8.5.2 for more detail). Redundant classes are not allowed in
restriction class lists. For example, the following method parameter?s
type restriction is redundant since INTEGER is a subclass of NUMBER.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defmethod foo ((?a INTEGER NUMBER)))
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If the type restriction (if any) is satisfied for an argument, then a
query restriction (if any) will be applied. The query restriction must
either be a global variable or a function call. CLIPS evaluates this
expression, and if it evaluates to anything but the symbol FALSE, the
restriction is considered satisfied. Since a query restriction is not
always satisfied, queries should <em>not</em> have any side-effects, for they
will be evaluated for a method that may not end up being applicable to
the generic function call. Since parameter restrictions are examined
from left to right, queries that involve multiple parameters should be
included with the rightmost parameter. This insures that all parameter
type restrictions have already been satisfied. For example, the
following method delays evaluation of the query restriction until the
classes of both arguments have been verified.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defmethod foo ((?a INTEGER) (?b INTEGER (&gt; ?a ?b))))
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If the argument passes all these tests, it is deemed acceptable to a
method. If <em>all</em> generic function arguments are accepted by a method?s
restrictions, the method itself is deemed <strong>applicable</strong> to the set of
arguments. When more than one method is applicable to a set of
arguments, the generic dispatch must determine an ordering among them
and execute the first one in that ordering. Method precedence is used
for this purpose and will be discussed in section 8.5.2.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<p>In the following example, the first call to the generic function ?+?
executes the system operator ?+?, an implicit method for numerical
addition. The second call executes the explicit method for string
concatenation, since there are two arguments and they are both strings.
The third call generates an error because the explicit method for string
concatenation only accepts two arguments and the implicit method for
numerical addition does not accept strings at all.</p>

<div class="section" id="method-wildcard-parameter">
<h3>8.4.4 Method Wildcard Parameter<a class="headerlink" href="#method-wildcard-parameter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A method may accept <em>exactly</em> or <em>at least</em> a specified number of
arguments, depending on whether a wildcard parameter is used or not. The
regular parameters specify the minimum number of arguments that must be
passed to the method. Each of these parameters may be referenced like a
normal single-field variable within the actions of the method. If a
wildcard parameter is present, the method may be passed any number of
arguments greater than or equal to the minimum. If no wildcard parameter
is present, then the method must be passed exactly the number of
arguments specified by the regular parameters. Method arguments that do
not correspond to a regular parameter can be grouped into a multifield
value that can be referenced by the wildcard parameter within the body
of the method. The standard CLIPS multifield functions, such as length$
and expand$, can be applied to the wildcard parameter.</p>
<p>If multifield values are passed as extra arguments, they will all be
merged into one multifield value referenced by the wildcard parameter.
This is because CLIPS does not support nested multifield values.</p>
<p>Type and query restrictions can be applied to arguments grouped in the
wildcard parameter similarly to regular parameters. Such restrictions
apply to each individual field of the resulting multifield value (not
the entire multifield). However, expressions involving the wildcard
parameter variable may be used in the query. In addition, a special
variable may be used in query restrictions on the wildcard parameter to
refer to the individual arguments grouped into the wildcard:
<strong>?current-argument</strong>. This variable is only in scope within the query
and has no meaning in the body of the method. For example, to create a
version of the ?+? operator which acts differently for sums of all even
integers:</p>
<p>Example</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>CLIPS&gt; (defmethod + (($?any INTEGER (evenp ?current-argument)))
  (div (call-next-method) 2))

CLIPS&gt; (+ 1 2)
3

CLIPS&gt; (+ 4 6 4)
7
CLIPS&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is important to emphasize that query and type restrictions on the
wildcard parameter are applied to every argument grouped in the
wildcard. Thus in the following example, the <strong>&gt;</strong> and <strong>length$</strong>
functions are actually called three times, since there are three
arguments:</p>
<p>Example</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>CLIPS&gt; (defmethod foo (($?any (&gt; (length$ ?any) 2))) yes)
CLIPS&gt; (foo 1 red 3)
yes
CLIPS&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In addition, a query restriction will never be examined if there are no
arguments in the wildcard parameter range. For example, the the previous
method<em>would</em> be applicable to a call to the generic function with no
arguments because the query restriction is never evaluated:</p>
<p>Example</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">CLIPS</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">yes</span>
<span class="n">CLIPS</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Typically query restrictions applied to the entire wildcard parameter
are testing the cardinality (the number of arguments passed to the
method). In cases like this where the type is irrelevant to the test,
the query restriction can be attached to a regular parameter instead to
improve performance (see section 8.5.1). Thus the previous method could
be improved as follows:</p>
<p>Example</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>CLIPS&gt; (clear)
CLIPS&gt; (defmethod foo ((?arg (&gt; (length$ ?any) 1)) $?any) yes)
CLIPS&gt; (foo)
[GENRCEXE1] No applicable methods for foo.
FALSE
CLIPS&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This approach should not be used if the types of the arguments grouped
by the wildcard must be verified prior to safely evaluating the query
restriction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="generic-dispatch">
<h2>8.5 Generic Dispatch<a class="headerlink" href="#generic-dispatch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When a generic function is called, CLIPS selects the method for that
generic function with highest precedence for which parameter
restrictions are satisfied by the arguments. This method is executed,
and its value is returned as the value of the generic function. This
entire process is referred to as the <strong>generic dispatch</strong>. Below is a

<div class="section" id="applicability-of-methods-summary">
<h3>8.5.1 Applicability of Methods Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#applicability-of-methods-summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An explicit (user-defined) method is applicable to a generic function
call if the following three conditions are met:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>its name matches that of the generic function,</li>
<li>it accepts at least as many arguments as were passed to the generic
function, and</li>
<li>every argument of the generic function satisfies the corresponding
parameter restriction (if any) of the method.</li>
</ol>
<p>Method restrictions are examined from left to right. As soon as one
restriction is not satisfied, the method is abandoned, and the rest of
the restrictions (if any) are not examined.</p>
<p>When a standard CLIPS system function is overloaded, CLIPS forms an
implicit method definition corresponding to that system function. This
implicit method is derived from the argument restriction string for the
external <strong>DefineFunction2</strong> call defining that function to CLIPS (see
the <em>Advanced Programming Guide</em>). This string can be accessed with the
function <strong>get-function-restrictions</strong>. The specification of this
implicit method can be examined with the <strong>list-defmethods</strong> or
<strong>get-method-restrictions</strong> functions. The method that CLIPS will form
for a system function can be derived by the user from the BNF given in
this document. For example,</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">number</span><span class="o">&gt;+</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>would yield the following method for the ?+? function:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defmethod + ((?first NUMBER) (?second NUMBER) ($?rest NUMBER)) ...)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The method definition is used to determine the applicability and
precedence of the system function to the generic function call.</p>
<p>The following system functions cannot be overloaded, and CLIPS will
generate an error if an attempt is made to do so.</p>

<h3>8.5.2 Method Precedence<a class="headerlink" href="#method-precedence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When two or more methods are applicable to a particular generic function
call, CLIPS must pick the one with highest <strong>precedence</strong> for execution.
Method precedence is determined when a method is defined; the
<strong>list-defmethods</strong> function can be used to examine the precedence of
methods for a generic function (see section 13.10).</p>
<p>The precedence between two methods is determined by comparing their
parameter restrictions. In general, the method with the most specific
parameter restrictions has the highest precedence. For example, a method
that demands an integer for a particular argument will have higher
precedence than a method which only demands a number. The exact rules of
precedence between two methods are given in order below; the result of
the first rule that establishes precedence is taken.</p>
<p>1. The parameter restrictions of both methods are positionally compared
from left to right. In other words, the first parameter restriction in
the first method is matched against the first parameter restriction in
the second method, and so on. The comparisons between these pairs of
parameter restrictions from the two methods determine the overall
precedence between the two methods. The result of the first pair of
parameter restrictions that specifies precedence is taken. The following
rules are applied in order to a parameter pair; the result of the first
rule that establishes precedence is taken.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li>A regular parameter has precedence over a wildcard parameter.</li>
<li>The most specific type restriction on a particular parameter has priority.
A class is more specific than any of its superclasses.</li>
<li>A parameter with a query restriction has priority over one that does not.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>The method with the greater number of regular parameters has precedence.</li>
<li>A method without a wildcard parameter has precedence over one that does</li>
<li>A method defined before another one has priority.</li>
</ol>
<p>If there are multiple classes on a single restriction, determining
specificity is slightly more complicated. Since all precedence
determination is done when the new method is defined, and the actual
class of the generic function argument will not be known until run-time,
arbitrary (but deterministic) rules are needed for determining the
precedence between two class lists. The two class lists are examined by
pairs from left to right, e.g. the pair of first classes from both
lists, the pair of second classes from both lists and so on. The first
pair containing a class and its superclass specify precedence. The class
list containing the subclass has priority. If no class pairs specify
precedence, then the shorter class list has priority. Otherwise, the
class lists do not specify precedence between the parameter
restrictions.</p>
<p>Example 1</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>; The system operator &#39;+&#39; is an implicit method ; #1
; Its definition provided by the system is:
; (defmethod + ((?a NUMBER) (?b NUMBER) ($?rest NUMBER)))
(defmethod + ((?a NUMBER) (?b INTEGER))) ; #2
(defmethod + ((?a INTEGER) (?b INTEGER))) ; #3
(defmethod + ((?a INTEGER) (?b NUMBER))) ; #4
(defmethod + ((?a NUMBER) (?b NUMBER) ; #5
($?rest PRIMITIVE)))
(defmethod + ((?a NUMBER) ; #6
(?b INTEGER (&gt; ?b 2))))
(defmethod + ((?a INTEGER (&gt; ?a 2)) ; #7
(?b INTEGER (&gt; ?b 3))))
(defmethod + ((?a INTEGER (&gt; ?a 2)) ; #8
(?b NUMBER)))
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The precedence would be: #7,#8,#3,#4,#6,#2,#1,#5. The methods can be
immediately partitioned into three groups of decreasing precedence
according to their restrictions on the first parameter: A) methods which
have a query restriction and a type restriction of INTEGER (#7,#8), B)
methods which have a type restriction of INTEGER (#3,#4), and C) methods
which have a type restriction of NUMBER (#1,#2,#5,#6). Group A has
precedence over group B because parameters with query restrictions have
priority over those that do not. Group B has precedence over group C
because INTEGER is a subclass of NUMBER. Thus, the ordering so far is:
(#7,#8),(#3,#4),(#1,#2,#5,#6). Ordering between the methods in a
particular set of parentheses is not yet established.</p>
<p>The next step in determining precedence between these methods considers
their restrictions on the second parameter. #7 has priority over #8
because INTEGER is a subclass of NUMBER. #3 has priority over #4 because
INTEGER is a subclass of NUMBER. #6 and #2 have priority over #1 and #5
because INTEGER is a subclass of NUMBER. #6 has priority over #2 because
it has a query restriction and #2 does not. Thus the ordering is now:
#7,#8,#3,#4,#6,#2,(#1,#5).</p>
<p>The restriction on the wildcard argument yields that #1 (the system
function implicit method) has priority over #5 since NUMBER is a
sublclass of PRIMITIVE. This gives the final ordering:
#7,#8,#3,#4,#6,#2,#1,#5.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defmethod foo ((?a NUMBER STRING))) ; #1
(defmethod foo ((?a INTEGER LEXEME))) ; #2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The precedence would be #2,#1. Although STRING is a subclass of LEXEME,
the ordering is still #2,#1 because INTEGER is a subclass of NUMBER, and
NUMBER/INTEGER is the leftmost pair in the class lists.</p>
<p>Example 3</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defmethod foo ((?a MULTIFIELD STRING))) ; #1
(defmethod foo ((?a LEXEME))) ; #2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The precedence would be #2,#1 because the classes of the first pair in
the type restriction (MULTIFIELD/LEXEME) are unrelated and #2 has fewer
classes in its class list.</p>
<p>Example 4</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>(defmethod foo ((?a INTEGER LEXEME))) ; #1
(defmethod foo ((?a STRING NUMBER))) ; #2
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Both pairs of classes (INTEGER/STRING and LEXEME/NUMBER) are unrelated,
and the class lists are of equal length. Thus, the precedence is taken
from the order of definition: #1,#2.</p>

<h3>8.5.3 Shadowed Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#shadowed-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If one method must be called by another method in order to be executed,
the first function or method is a said to be <strong>shadowed</strong> by the second
method. Normally, only one method or system function will be applicable
to a particular generic function call. If there is more than one
applicable method, the generic dispatch will only execute the one with
highest precedence. Letting the generic dispatch automatically handle
the methods in this manner is called the <strong>declarative</strong> technique, for
the declarations of the method restrictions dictate which method gets
executed in specific circumstances. However, the functions
<strong>call-next-method</strong> and <strong>override-next-method</strong> (see section 12.15.6
and 12.15.7) may also be used which allow a method to execute the method
that it is shadowing. This is called the <strong>imperative</strong> technique, since
the method execution itself plays a role in the generic dispatch. This
is <em>not</em> recommended unless it is absolutely necessary. In most
circumstances, only one piece of code should need to be executed for a
particular set of arguments. Another imperative technique is to use the
function <strong>call-specific-method</strong> to override method precedence (see
section 12.15.8)</p>

<h3>8.5.4 Method Execution Errors<a class="headerlink" href="#method-execution-errors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If an error occurs while any method for a generic function call is
executing, any actions in the current method not yet executed will be
aborted, any methods not yet called will be aborted, and the generic
function will return the symbol FALSE. The lack of any applicable
methods for a set of generic function arguments is considered a method
execution error.</p>

<div class="section" id="generic-function-return-value">
<h3>8.5.5 Generic Function Return Value<a class="headerlink" href="#generic-function-return-value" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The return value of a generic function is the return value of the
applicable method with the highest precedence. Each applicable method
that is executed can choose to ignore or capture the return value of any
method that it is shadowing.</p>
<p>The return value of a particular method is the last action evaluated by
that method.</p>

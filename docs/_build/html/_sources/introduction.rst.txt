Section 1: Introduction
=======================

This manual is the *Basic Programming Guide* for CLIPS. It is intended 
for users interested in the syntax of CLIPS. No previous expert system
background is required, al­though a general understanding of computer
languages is assumed. Section 2 of this manual provides an overview of
the CLIPS language and basic terminology. Sections 3 through 11 provide
additional details regarding the CLIPS programming language on topics
such as rules and the CLIPS Object Oriented Programming Language (COOL).
The types of actions and functions provided by CLIPS are defined in
section 12. Finally, commands typically used from the CLIPS interactive
interface are described in section 13.

The *Basic Programming Guide* documents just the basic CLIPS syntax.
More advanced capabilities, such as user-defined functions, embedded
applications, etc., are docu­mented more fully in the *Advanced
Programming Guide*. The *Advanced Programming Guide* is intended for
users who have a complete knowledge of the CLIPS syntax and a
programming background. It is *not* necessary to read the *Advanced
Program­ming Guide* to learn how to use CLIPS. CLIPS can be learned and
simple expert systems can be built with the information provided in this
manual.
